BenchanTech LLC is where technology, narrative architecture, and music intersect.

Founded by Ben Chan, this company explores how **stories, systems, and sound** can echo forward in time. From the *YY and Me* podcast to the *Open Code Orchestra* initiative and the **BenChanViolin** YouTube channel, the work spans creative and technical domains while maintaining one goal:

**Build in plain sight.**

BenchanTech LLC helps others design **recursive systems**â€”projects that outlast metrics and resonate across generations. Whether through code, consulting, or composition, the focus is on building frameworks that sustain value and meaning over time.
