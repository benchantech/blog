Hello world.

In 2007, I excitedly published my first YouTube video after hours of practice. I taught myself how to set up, record and upload. I was finally making my debut online.

Over the next 7 days, I received a grand total of **24 views**.

I felt frustrated, annoyed. Confused. I had thought that the quality of my playing would attract a lot more people.

I kept publishing. Weeks of silence.

*The Void is gamer shorthand for grinding early levels with no rewards — for creators, it's publishing when no one notices.*

Eighteen years and 16 million views later, I'm back in the Void again. No one's listening—yet.

Staying motivated is the only way through. Here's what keeps me going.

## Shifting Mindset

I accept that I'm new to writing. Like my old cardboard-box violin, these first posts are rough: dropped, frequently, then picked up again with a slightly better grasp. Each revision sharpens one part, revealing new issues I didn't catch last time.

I'm not playing the lottery. Most people drop ticket after ticket down a hole, expecting a fortune to randomly spring back up. Um, that's not how gravity works; it's like expecting my box violin to just leap back into my hand — cardboard doesn't bounce.

Here's what I'm telling myself:

* Expect to mess up a bunch. The value is in picking it back up, like a violin.
* Don't chase virality. It took me 18 years to hit 16 million views — a long-term investment.

## Declaring Goals

My biggest challenge is perfectionism: iterating endlessly and never committing. That was past me; I'm older, wiser, and still screwing things up — just faster now.

Accepting roughness isn't enough. I needed a system to keep going when motivation fades.

**Publishing Cadence** — I'm going to publish once every two weeks, no matter what. Even when it's embarrassing. Even when I re-read it the next day and cringe. If I miss, I'll pay it back with an extra post.

**Quantity Over Quality** — I can't guarantee quality yet, but I can guarantee quantity. It hurt my ears to start violin, but I kept making noise. Just keep writing.

**Asking For Feedback** — I can ask family, friends, and YouTube viewers for feedback. I'm not above begging, but I'm hoping they don't make me… they probably will.

Bring it on, Void.

## Taking Action

My trash is filled with failed drafts. Fear didn't stop me in 2007 — and it won't stop me now.

Eighteen years ago, 24 people showed up for my first video. If you're reading this, you're early — and that matters.
