## Who is Ben Chan?

I'm still figuring that out, honestly. But here's what I know so far.

I build things that echo forward: systems that speak across time, bridging the space between who we are now and who we're becoming. **Legacy Build Strategist** feels like the closest job title, though it doesn't quite capture the violinist in me, or the technologist, or the parent obsessing over recursive narratives at 2 AM.

### The Accidental Architecture

For 18+ years, I've been building something without really knowing what it was:
- **65,000 YouTube subscribers** emerged from nothing
- **16 million views** accumulated while I wasn't watching the numbers  
- **300 videos**, zero advertising dollars
- **10,000 Facebook followers** who found me through some invisible thread of connection
- Consulting clients who come through referrals and resonance, not marketing funnels

This isn't from deliberate strategy. It's simply archaeology: uncovering what was already there.

### The Work

The work centers around **narrative architecture**, though that phrase makes it sound more academic than it feels. Really, I'm engineering emotional systems that echo forward in time.

My podcast project *YY and Me* ([yyand.me](https://yyand.me/the-first-echo)) is part memoir, part experiment, part message-in-a-bottle for my children, especially their future selves. Using frameworks I've developed, including **story arcs**, **mnemonic music motifs**, and **diegetic sponsorships**, this podcast become a living case study of how stories can carry weight across generations.

I call these episodes **recursive narrative systems** because they fold back on themselves, creating meaning that compounds over time. They're designed to be inherited, evolved, built upon. 

### Who I Help

Now I help others build their own versions. The people who find me are usually high performers who've mastered the business game but sense there's something deeper they're meant to pass on:

- CEOs
- Founders  
- Creatives
- Artists

People who've achieved success but feel this **urgency** to construct something that endures beyond metrics, beyond themselves.

### The Source

My family is woven through everything I make. The podcast narratives emerge from real moments: parenting chaos, inherited patterns, the **weight** of what we pass down. It's the **source**, above and beyond mere content strategy. Understanding my own emotional landscapes helps me guide others through theirs.

### The Transition

The goal is simple: **freedom from trading hours for income**. I'm transitioning from active consulting to building teachable systemsâ€”frameworks that work whether I'm in the room or not. Creating value through structure rather than presence.

Anyways, if you've found external success but feel an internal pull toward something more lasting, this might be for you. Listen to the podcast first ([yyand.me](https://yyand.me/the-first-echo)). If the work speaks to you, let's build something that echoes forward together.

*This is part memoir, part manifesto, part invitation. Still figuring it out, but that's where the interesting work happens.*
